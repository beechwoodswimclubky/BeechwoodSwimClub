        <p>Please fill out the 2025 Membership Information Form and email it to <a href="mailto:beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com">beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com</a>.

      <p style="color: #fff;">For people seeking for Beechwood Swim Club membership, we have started a new email address specifically related to our waitlist and membership inquiries. 
      It is: <a style="color: #fff;" href="mailto:waitlist.beechwoodswimclub@gmail.com">waitlist.beechwoodswimclub@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p style="color: #fff;">If you have already inquired in the past, you do *not* have send one to the new address. The waitlist / bond / rental inquiries 
      were simply overwhelming our club email address, so we needed to separate them out. </p>

        <h2>Membership Tags</h2>
        <p>Besides getting the pool ready we are working hard to get our new cards/tags ready! These will be able to be put on your keychain. You will receive your new tags at your first visit to the Swim Club. You will need your tags to scan in every time you visit.  We will no longer allow the front desk staff to look members up for entry.  This delays other members being able to enter in a timely fashion. To ensure quick entry into the Swim Club please have your tag ready or a picture of it to scan into the computer. If a look up is required, the manager will be called to the front office to help you.</p>
        <p>Replacement tags will be $5 per tag.</p>

        <p>As we head into the 2025 season, we are continuing our commitment to provide the most widespread information to our members as possible, so that everyone feels up to speed on what is happening.

Major items, such as our bylaws and this yearâ€™s member letter, will always be posted to our website. Please regularly check your email, our website, and our Facebook page so that you can stay informed of all events happening at the pool. </p>
