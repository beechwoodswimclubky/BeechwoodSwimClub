We hope that the recent warm weather has you excited for the upcoming summer, as it does us. For the last couple months, work has been happening daily to get the facilities ready to go for our members on opening weekend, and it is nice to see things coming together. 

As many are aware, the Board of Directors voted this year to increase the late fee for dues not paid by the deadline. In past years, many members opted not to pay on time, resulting in a sudden sense of urgency on opening weekend when members of the board were preoccupied with other pool matters or family obligations over a holiday weekend. Some payments were being made well into June and even during July. 

The payment deadline and increased late fee were publicized in more than one email, as well as posted on our Facebook page and on our website. Increased communication to our members has been a recent goal for us, and that is why this information was posted in multiple places. Over 80% of members paid on time - a much higher figure than past years - so the only conclusion we can reach is that our communication was indeed effective.

The world is evolving away from paper communication, and so is Beechwood Swim Club. From here forward, communications from the board will be disseminated electronically; not via traditional mail. In the last couple weeks, there have been a variety of reasons given for missing the payment deadline ranging from not receiving any emails, to emails going to spam folders, to receiving the emails and choosing not to read them, to knowing about the deadline but forgetting due to life events like vacations and proms. Many of these reasons have not been compelling to the board, as we cannot control when a child's prom is or what an internet provider does with an email. 

One issue that has arisen is members who did not recognize the importance of having a current, reliable email on file with the club. For some, the email went to an email address that they no longer utilize or was associated with a previous employer. Because they did not contact the club to update the contact information, their communication was sent to their former email. Because this evolution and transition toward solely electronic communication is relatively recent, some members did not see the need to update the contact information. 

In recognizing this period of transition, the board has voted to offer a one-time reprieve from the increased late fee. Members who did not pay prior to the April 15th deadline can pay their 2022 dues and a $75 late fee (a 50% reduction in the late fee approved by the board for this year) by **11:59 pm on Tuesday, May 17th, 2022**. There will not be an extension to this opportunity.  If you owe membership dues for previous years, please contact us via email to discuss.

For those members who have already paid the $150 late fee, we will offer you three different options:

1. We can reimburse you $75 via check or credit (depending on how you paid)
2. We can give you $75 in concession stand credit
3. We can apply the $75 to your 2023 membership dues

If you are planning on being Inactive for the 2022 season, you must inform the pool by May 17.  Payment is due by 15-June.  If no payment is made by 15-June, your bonds will be purchased by the pool for the face value amount of the bond.

For the future, please ensure that you have a permanent and reliable email address on file with the pool where you will be reachable regardless of a change in employment or other life event. If your email changes, it is your responsibility to change it through your profile or to contact the pool via email to request an update. We would also recommend that you make a point to follow our Facebook page and periodically check it, as well as the pool website, during the off-season. 

We serve in this capacity for our members and the summer experience of our members is always our priority. However, we want to be transparent that this flexibility will not be an annual occurrence, so please make sure to do what you can to work with us to get the pool in the financial and logistical position to start the season off successfully by making timely payments in the future. 

If you have sold your bonds or feel like you should not have received this communication, please contact us via email immediately.

Regards,
Beechwood Board of Directors
