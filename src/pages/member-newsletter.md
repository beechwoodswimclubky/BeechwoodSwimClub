Members,

We are eagerly looking forward to the 2022 season at Beechwood Swim Club.  Since the close of the 2021 season, the Board of Directors has met regularly to discuss the strengths and learning experiences of last summer and what to carry forward with us to optimize the experience for members in 2022.

From the perspective of the Board, last summer was a very successful year for the club.  Our staff’s increased grasp over the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as patience of our members, allowed a far more normalized summer experience reminiscent of years past than we were able to provide in the summer of 2020.  On behalf of the Board, we wish to offer a sincere thank you to everyone for making it possible; to our staff for navigating the complications with positivity and to our members for working with us to make the season not just possible, but memorable.  At the end of the day, we all have the same goal: to continue the legacy of a safe, family-oriented experience that has fostered memories, friendships, and community for generations.

In our discussions, the Board of Directors was unwavering in the belief that there was no factor more crucial to the success of the 2021 season than the sheer good fortune of coming across Nick Hovan and Jennifer Miller to manage the club.  We are both relieved and excited to announce that both Nick and Jennifer have agreed to return this summer as co-managers to lead the club for another season.

Often, we must ask ourselves whether we are making the correct choices and taking the club in the direction it needs to go. For us, there is no better indication that we are on the right track than the level of interest regarding membership. The number of inquiries regarding bond purchases and rental memberships is unprecedented for recent history.  Our waitlist is growing each week so, for that reason, it is necessary for us to obtain an accurate picture of our membership for this season. This necessitates an earlier deadline for payment of dues this season. To avoid a late fee, **all dues must be paid or postmarked on** *April 15, 2022*.  Dues not paid by or postmarked by April 15, 2022 will be assessed a non-negotiable **late fee of $150.00**.  However, the sooner we have a grasp on our membership for the summer, the more accurate information we can give prospective members. As an incentive to pay sooner, any members who pay their dues *on or before April 1, 2022* will have **five (5) free guest passes** added to their account.  The 2022 membership dues for each type of membership are as follows:

* Family - $450 (owner, spouse & dependent children –or– owner & 2 permanent guest passes)
* Senior - $360 (20% discount for owners 65 & older)
* Single - $315 (30% discount for members 18 & older)
* Babysitter - $100
* Guest Fee - $7 before 4pm, $5 after 4pm and for groups of 10 or more 

There are two ways that dues can be paid.  The first is to log into your account using the link at the bottom of this email and pay by credit card.  The second option is to mail a check to Beechwood Swim Club, PO Box 17066, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017. 

On the same topic, increased membership interest compels the club to address the bondholders that opt to go inactive for the summer of 2022.  The *inactive fee* for the 2022 season is *$292.50*.   Bondholders who wish to be inactive must inform the board *in writing* by *May 15, 2022*.  After that date, the opportunity to be inactive for the summer will have lapsed, and the bondholder will be subject to the full dues amount.  Additionally, the inactive fee of $292.50 must be paid or postmarked by *June 15, 2022*. Failure to pay the inactive fee by that date will result in the club purchasing your bond from you at the original bond value.

Due to the unprecedented demand for both bonds and rental memberships, we need to assess the number of rental memberships that will be available this season.  A separate letter will be sent to previous and potential renter families within the next few weeks.

Finally, unpaid fees, dues, and other costs from the past limits our ability to provide services to members who make full, timely payments. Regardless of any past practices, please understand that it is the intent of the board to enforce such fees this season. If membership dues are not paid before April 15, 2022, the $150.00 will be assessed, and your family will not be granted access to the facilities until it is paid.

Like you all, we receive a lot of emails with a lot of information in it, so for the benefit of our members merely scanning this letter, the relevant dates as it relates to dues are these:

* April 1, 2022 – dues paid in full / postmarked will get five (5) free guest passes
* April 15, 2022 – dues must be paid/postmarked to avoid $150.00 late fee
* May 15, 2022 – members wishing to be inactive must have informed the board in writing
* June 15, 2022 – inactive fees must be paid or bond will be unilaterally purchased back

If you need to transfer bonds, Stephanie Bogenschutz will be available to meet you at the pool on the following days:

* 5/20/22 from 5:00 – 6:00 pm
* 5/22/22 from 2:00 – 3:00 pm 
* 5/25/22 from 5:00 – 6:00 pm
* 5/29/22 from 11:00 am – 12:00 pm


Please feel free to contact us at [beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com](mailto:beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com) for any questions you may have. Be watching for an email in May that will detail the events we have planned so that you can get them on your calendar. We are extremely excited to spend the season with the many families who make the club the summer staple that we have all grown to love. Stay safe and warm, members; sunny days are ahead.

Sincerely,

Beechwood Board of Directors
