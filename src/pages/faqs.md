Beechwood Swim Club is a non-profit corporation owned by its members through the issuance of bonds. The general operations of the club are overseen by a board of directors consisting of member volunteers elected by bond-holders, and the daily functions are overseen by management employed by the board.

*What does it mean to be a bond-holder?*

The vast majority of members at Beechwood Swim Club are bond-holders. The ownership of the swim club consists of 500 bonds issued to members by the board of directors. The bond is a one-time expense that essentially gives the bond-holder an ownership interest in the club and the ability to elect the board of directors. Once purchased, the bond remains with the holder indefinitely, as long as they remain in good standing, until they opt to transfer it to another or sell it back to the club. As a bond-holder, one commits to paying their annual membership dues or, in the alternative, an inactive fee for that season, making bond ownership a more permanent membership option than other, such as rentals.

*How does someone become a bond-holder?*

Bonds are available for purchase directly from the club or from bond-holders in private sales. Information about either type of purchase can be obtained by sending an inquiry to [beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com](mailto:beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com)

*What are the annual dues for a bond-holder?*

The annual dues depend on the type of membership the bond-holder chooses for the season. A breakdown of the various memberships and annual dues associated with each can be found here.\*\** (Stephanie, make “here” a link to the dues breakdown I mentioned from 5 seasons if we choose to go that route?)
