Welcome to the 2021 Beechwood Swim Club season!  Beechwood Swim Club is a non-profit corporation operated by a group of elected volunteers.  Our main goal is to maintain a safe, family oriented recreational facility that will continue to foster memories, friendships, and legacies for future generations.  The 2021 Beechwood Swim Club Board of Directors are:

* Josh Colvin – President
* Jim Brannen – Vice President
* Stephanie Bogenschutz – Treasurer
* Barb Erardi – Secretary
* Gene Burchell – Director
* Kyle Burns – Director
* Kelley Young – Director

As you can see, the board has changed significantly from previous years.  We would like to thank Sherry Lentsch for her 18 years on the board with 17 of those years serving as the President.  We would also like to thank Steve Novak for his 12 years on the board with 11 of those years serving as the Treasurer, Mark Gamel for his 6 years serving on the Board with 3 of those years as the Vice President, and Tony Shoyat for his 5 years serving as a director.  Their efforts and commitment have set the pool up for a very bright future and their contributions are much appreciated and will always be remembered.

We would also like to recognize and thank Jake Lentsch for his 5 years as the Head Manager.  The pool and the premises were always well maintained under his watch and he always employed a courteous and qualified staff.  He also saved the pool money by completing countless repairs himself.  His experience and knowledge will be missed.

We would like to thank all members for their patience and understanding last year for following the Covid-19 restrictions set forth by the Health Department.  Your willingness to accept and follow these new policies helped make 2020 a very successful swim season in spite of numerous challenges.

The Board of Directors prides itself in keeping annual membership dues affordable and among the lowest in the area.  Last season, we prorated the membership dues because of the shortened season due to Covid-19 pandemic.  This year, we anticipate being able to open on Memorial Day Weekend but could be limited to the same capacity restrictions as last year.  Therefore, we will return to the full annual membership fee that was charged in 2019.  The 2021 membership dues are:

Family - $450 (owner, spouse & dependent children –or– owner & 2 permanent guest passes)
Senior - $360 (20% discount for owners 65 & older)
Single - $315 (30% discount for members 18 & older)
Inactive - $292.50 (35% discount for owners who will not use the facility in 2021)
Family Renter - $600
Single Renter - $420
Babysitter - $100
Guest Fee - $7 before 4pm, $5 after 4pm and for groups of 10 or more
If anything changes to our opening date to due Covid-19 restrictions, we will send out an update to all members as soon as possible.
