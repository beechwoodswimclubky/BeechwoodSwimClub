## Hello Members!

The temperature was in the 70's today, and we are gaining more minutes of daylight with each passing day. Before we know it, winter will be a distant memory, and the sights, sounds, and feelings that have defined summer for generations of us will be alive at Beechwood Swim Club. 

One of the more prominent changes from last season is that the club is transitioning to a new management software called [Member Splash](https://beechwoodswimclub.membersplash.com/). Several board members vetted new software programs and concluded that Member Splashwas a more sophisticated option to serve the growing need for online management and communication with our members. While many of the benefits may not be visible from the perspective of members, our new software will allow you to pay your membership, buy guest passes, as well as have the front gate staff check you and your guests in quickly at the front gate. There is a learning curve with any new software, and while we are confident in the need for the switch, we ask that you be patient with us when technology issues inevitably arise. **Information on how to log into [Member Splash](https://beechwoodswimclub.membersplash.com/) is provided at the conclusion of this newsletter**.

The switch to the new software meant that our records of our membership needed to be transferred, which unfortunately involved a significant amount of manual entry and time. However, the silver lining is that this account-by-account data entry revealed that many of our member accounts still contained outdated information, and this was a prime opportunity to update our records to see that our biographical information is presently accurate. Thus, we are requiring each member to fill out a **membership information form** so that we can update and cross-check the information. Only one form is required per membership; you do not have to submit one individually for households with multiple people. **The membership information form can be accessed by clicking [here](https://mcusercontent.com/d2234782ae340940dd72dad5c/files/2f9f3a94-e80b-881d-abe7-cb7c083f3e91/Membership_Information_Form_._Final_Version.docx)**. Please fill out the form and return it to us either by email to <beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com> (preferred) or by mailing it to PO Box 17066, Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, 41017 by April 15th. Your account will not be active on opening weekend if the membership form has not been received, so please return it to avoid unnecessary hardship on what should be an exciting weekend. Instructions on accessing [Member Splash](https://beechwoodswimclub.membersplash.com/) are contained further down. 

Another necessary change that some may perceive as significant is that **we will not be accepting checks by mail to our PO Box this year**. Last year, we ran into far too many circumstances of checks becoming lost in the mail, being delayed by weeks, never arriving at all, being placed in another PO Box, and a multitude of other issues. To eliminate these problems for the benefit of both our members and the board members processing the payments, we are not accepting checks via mail. However, in recognizing that some of our members will still desire to pay by check rather than online, we are providing opportunities to deliver checks.  A board member will be present on the following dates, times, and locations to accept them:

- **March 1st, 5:00 - 7:00 PM, Fort Mitchell City Building**
- **March 11th, 1:00 - 2:30 PM, Erlanger Public Library, Anne Room**
- **April 15th, 12:00 - 2:00 PM, Beechwood Swim Club**

Members wishing to pay by check can bring their check to the club on those designated occasions. Otherwise, please utilize the online payment function in [Member Splash](https://beechwoodswimclub.membersplash.com/).

The membership dues for the 2023 season remain unchanged from the 2022 season. However, the State of Kentucky has passed a new law effective January 1, 2023 that requires a 6% sales tax to be applied to club membership fees.  The sales tax has been added to the membership dues and are listed below: 

**Family** - $477 ($450 dues + $27 sales tax)
- Option 1: Owner, spouse & dependent children who are 25 years old or younger and residing in the home. 
- Option 2: Owner & two (2) permanent guest passes

**Senior** ‐ $381.60 ($360 dues + $21.60 sales tax) 
- At least one (1) member must be sixty-five (65) or older

**Single** ‐ $333.90 ($315 dues + $18.90 sales tax)

**Babysitter** ‐ $106 ($100 + $6 sales tax)
- Up to two (2) designated babysitters can be listed on the account for a charge of   $100.00 each plus 6% sales tax. The babysitter pass can only be used when one (1) or more of the dependent children are present and neither parent is present. 

The deadlines for payment of 2023 dues are as follows:
- **March 15th, 2023** - Members who pay on or before this date will receive five (5) free guest passes added to their account
- **April 15th, 2023** - Members must pay on or before this date to avoid being a assessed a late fee

**For payments after April 15th, 2023, there will be a late fee assessed of $150.00**. For accounts subject to a late fee, the account will not be active on opening weekend unless the late fee has been paid. The Board of Directors wants nothing more than to assess absolutely **zero** late fees. It is our hope that by sharing these deadlines over the last year and posting them in multiple places, all dues are paid timely, and no late fee is assessed to any member. However, to encourage compliance with the deadlines and allow the board to make financial decisions for the upcoming season, the late fee must exist, and it will be enforced. Please pay on time so that opening weekend is nothing but smiles for both sides. 
 
Due to ongoing spike in membership interest, it is important that we know how many members plan to be inactive in the 2023 season. Members who wish to be inactive must notify the board in writing by May 15th, 2023. The inactive fee will be $310 ($292.50 + 6% sales tax). Likewise, **the inactive fee must be paid by June 15th, 2023**, to keep the account in good standing. Failure to notify the board of an intent to be inactive will subject you to the full membership dues for the season, and failure to pay the inactive fee by **June 15th, 2023**, will result in the club purchasing your bond from you at the original bond value.
 
For our new members who have purchased bonds since last season, your bond must be formally transferred before your account will be active. If you need to transfer bonds, Stephanie Bogenschutz will be available to meet you at the pool on the following days:

- 5/3/23 from 5:00 – 6:00 pm
- 5/10/23 from 5:00 – 6:00 pm
- 5/12/23 from 4:00 – 5:30 pm
- 5/27/23 from 11:00 am – 12:00 pm

As always, if you have questions, please feel free to contact us at the swim club email, which is <beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com>. As much as the contents of this letter may now sound direct, please understand it is merely out of a desire to convey information clearly and without room for misunderstanding. Each member of the Board of Directors genuinely cares about Beechwood Swim Club; its past, its present, and its future. Each of you is a part of that; some of you the past, all of you the present, and hopefully many of you the future. Preserving the summer experience that is Beechwood Swim Club for current and future generations is what drives us to join the board, and that experience would not exist without our members. 
 
As we head into the 2023 season, we are continuing our commitment to provide the most widespread information to our members as possible, so that everyone feels up to speed on what is happening. Issues in the past with emails have led us to try to post updates across multiple platforms including email, our pool website, and our pool [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/people/Beechwood-Swim-Club/100063776424126/). Major items, such as our newly updated bylaws and this year’s member letter, will always be posted to our [website](https://www.beechwoodswimclub.org/). However, for the most timely and current updates, such as closure of the pool due to weather and things of that nature, our Facebook page is the best place to stay informed. Please stay up to speed with your email, our website, and our Facebook page so that we have the best chance of reaching you. 

Lastly the club is hiring employees for this upcoming summer. Interviews will be held in the Anne Room of the Erlanger Public Library on March 11th and March 19th from 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM. This information is included in the flyer attached [here](https://mcusercontent.com/d2234782ae340940dd72dad5c/images/63b915e9-abe9-b245-9183-0de45990d5bf.jpg). We would love to have our local kids join us this summer. 
 
Mark your calendars for Opening Day, Saturday, May 27th. We cannot wait to see you; sunnier days are ahead.
