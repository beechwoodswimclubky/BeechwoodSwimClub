 <p style="color: #fff;">For people seeking for Beechwood Swim Club membership, we have started a new email address specifically related to our waitlist and membership inquiries. It is: <a style="color: #fff !important;" href="mailto:waitlist.beechwoodswimclub@gmail.com">waitlist.beechwoodswimclub@gmail.com</a></p>
 <p style="color: #fff;">If you have already inquired in the past, you do *not* have send one to the new address. The waitlist / bond / rental inquiries were simply overwhelming our club email address, so we needed to separate them out. </p>

## Hello Members!

2024 Beechwood Swim Club Board of Directors

* Josh Colvin – President
* Barb Erardi – Vice President
* Stephanie Bogenschutz – Treasurer
* John Piccirillo – Secretary
* Cheryl Ralph – Director
* Laurie Baurer – Director
* Eric Mooney – Director

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">News from the Board of Directors</p>
<p>It may be hard to imagine at this point, but the swim season officially begins in 100 days on Saturday, May 25.   We are very excited for the upcoming swim season and excited to share the following information with Beechwood’s members.</p>
 
<p>The Board of Directors would like to welcome our newest Board Members: Laurie Bauer, Eric Mooney, and John Piccirillo.  We are looking forward to working with Laurie, Eric, and John to ensure that Beechwood Swim Club continues to be a fun, safe, and family friendly experience for its members for years to come.</p>
 
<p>Last year saw some significant changes for members with the change to the Member Splash software system.  While there was a learning curve with the system as we progressed through the season, the overall benefits of the new system were noticed by all.  We will continue to use Member Splash as our membership software for the 2024 season.  The link to Beechwood’s Member Splash site is <a href="https://beechwoodswimclub.membersplash.com/">https://beechwoodswimclub.membersplash.com</a></p>
 
<p>Over the past several years, we have made significant investments to maintain the pool, deck, and facilities.  For 2024, the Board has committed to the following improvements to the Swim Club.</p>

<ul>
    <li>First, additional lounge chairs will be purchased for the pool deck.  Demand was high last season for lounge chairs on weekends, so additional chairs should help to lessen the demand as pool attendance continues to increase.</li>
    <li>Second, a pickleball court will be installed in the play area next to the basketball courts.  We are excited to be able to bring pickleball to the club for our members.  There will be additional information shared on the pickleball courts as we get closer to the pool season.</li>
</ul>
 
<p style="font-weight: bold;">2024 Membership Dues</p>
<p>Due to increasing costs in staffing, chemicals, and other items necessary to keep the pool operational, the Board voted to increase membership dues for the first time since 2018.  While membership dues have increased, the Board worked to keep annual membership dues affordable and among the lowest in the area while also balancing the costs to operate the club successfully and plan for future renovations.  The 2024 dues are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Family - $524.70 ($495 dues + $29.70 KY sales tax)<p>

As we head into the 2024 season, we are continuing our commitment to provide the most widespread information to our members as possible, so that everyone feels up to speed on what is happening. Issues in the past with emails have led us to try to post updates across multiple platforms including email, our pool website, and our pool Facebook page. Major items, such as our bylaws and this year's member letter, will always be posted to our website. Please regularly check your email, our website, and our Facebook page so that you can stay informed of all events happening at the pool.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">August Lifeguarding Help Needed</p>
<p>Due to our guards and managers going back to school in mid-August last year, the pool could not open until 4pm Monday through Friday for the last two weeks of the swim season.  This was an extremely unfortunate situation and not a decision that the Board took lightly.</p>
 
<p>To keep the pool open once school starts back in August this year, we are asking adult members to consider getting their Lifeguard certification.  Members will need to commit to 2 shifts (12-4) per week for 2 weeks.  We would need 2 people per day (Monday – Friday) starting mid-August.  We are looking for a maximum of 10 volunteers.  Lifeguarding certification class information will be sent out separately to those interested.</p>
 
<p>Please know that there are additional trainings on our emergency protocols at Beechwood Swim Club.  Volunteers must attend those trainings as well.  The pool will reimburse the volunteers for their certification and compensate you for your time.</p>

Beechwood Board of Directors</p>
