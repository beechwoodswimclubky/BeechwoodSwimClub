### We are the Beechwood Barracudas!

The Beechwood Barracudas are a summer recreational swim and dive team that is a member of the Northern Kentucky Swim League.  The season begins in early June and typically ends in late July.  Practices are held Monday through Thursday mornings.  Diving meets are on Tuesday evenings and Swimming meets are on Thursday evenings.

The main goal of the Beechwood Barracudas is to provide a fun environment where the children can make new friends while becoming stronger swimmers and graceful divers.  All skill levels are welcome.  To be on the swim team, your child should be able to swim 1 length of the pool freestyle and 1 length backstroke.  If a swimmer cannot swim the length of the pool, they can start with the Little Cudas, which will work on teaching the fundamentals of competitive swimming and building up endurance.

**Beechwood Barracuda Swim and Dive Team 2021**

Hello to all returning Cuda Families and potential New Cuda Families! 

Welcome to the summer 2021 Swim and Dive Season!!!  I am very excited that the Beechwood Barracudas are back in 2021 after taking the 2020 season off due to COVID-19.  I know that my daughter and son missed being on the Cudas in 2020 and I am sure yours did as well.

The Beechwood Barracudas Swim & Dive Team Boosters and Coaches invite your children to join us this summer for lots of fun, exercise and excitement!!  The Swim/Dive team is a great way for your children to make new friends at the pool and become more confident in their abilities either in the pool or going off the diving board. 

The main goal of the Cudas Swim & Dive Team is for your child to have fun and learn about the sports of swimming and diving.  I am very excited with the coaches that we have for this summer.  It will be a great summer season. 

The Beechwood Barracudas are a recreational team that competes in the Northern Kentucky Swim League (NKSL).  Practices start the week of Wednesday, 2-June, and run through the week of 27-July.

**Participation Requirements:**

All pool members in good standing are eligible to participate on the swim and dive team. 

For the Swim Team, the child must be able to swim unassisted one lap freestyle and one lap backstroke. 

If they are not able to do this unassisted, your child can be a member of the Little Cuda Swim Team.  This is for the children that can at least push off the walls on their belly and back all by themselves but just not able to complete a full lap of the stroke.  We have experienced coaches who will continue to work with your child on their strokes and endurance.  As your child progresses, they could have the opportunity to participate in the NKSL meets later in the season.

Parents of Swim/Dive Team members are required to work at least FOUR of the diving and swim team events during the season.  Parents can sign up for jobs on the Team Unify site weekly.

Beechwood is hosting the Diving Champ Meets this year.  We will need help from the parents to work the two evenings of July 27 & 28.  

There will be a Diving Judge clinic at Beechwood before the season starts.  I will ask that all Diving Parents attend this clinic so that they can be judges for the diving meets.\
There will also be an eDive software training before the season starts.  I will be asking for volunteers to attend so that they can run the software during the 3 home diving meets.
We will need all hands on deck to host this Champ Meet.  Even if your child does not dive, please consider volunteering

***TEAM PRACTICE SCHEDULE:***

Diving:  Monday – Thursday for 1 hour between 8:00am – 10:00am beginning Monday, 1-June.  Work with the coach to set your practice time.  This is flexible and can be worked around your swim practice schedule as well.

Swimming:  Monday - Thursday mornings between the hours of 8:00-10:00am for approximately 1 hour each day. Practices begin Monday, 1-June.  The 8 & under and 9-10 age groups will practice from 8:00-9:00.  The 11-12, 13-14, and 15-18 age groups will practice from 9:00-10:00.

Little Cudas begin practice on Tuesday, June 8th. They practice Tuesday – Thursday for 6 weeks. 

All practice times will be posted on the Team Bulletin Board at the Pool by Opening Day (29-May).

***2021 MEET SCHEDULE:***

There are 6 regular Swim & Dive Meets beginning June 8/10th.  In late July there will be All-star Swim & Dive meets as well as the Championship meets. Meet schedule is included. **NOTE:** Due to the number of teams in the NKSL, a seven-week schedule was necessary to ensure all teams within their division would compete against each other.  No team wanted to do tri-meets, so with the extra week in the season, each team having a bye week.  This has extended the Swim/Dive season by one week.

**Diving Meets:** Held TUESDAY evenings beginning June 8th at various NKSL locations

**Swim Meets:** Held THURSDAY evenings beginning June 10th at various NKSL locations.
